# Welcome to Stoic GNU/Linux!

## Introduction
Stoic GNU/Linux, is a linux distro, forked from Ataraxia Linux, that is made to be as systemd free as possible, while being lightweight, fast, simple, and secure. We aim to make sure PID 1 stays simple, and secure. This has all the good stuff that Ataraxia Linux has, and we aim to add what Ataraxia Linux is missing, and needs. Have an look around!
